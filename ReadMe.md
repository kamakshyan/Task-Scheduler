# Task Scheduler (C++)

A simple command-line task scheduler written in C++ 20.


## Features
- Add, view, complete, and delete tasks
- Priorities and deadlines
- Time left display with chrono
- Console UI

## Build & Run

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./task_scheduler
```

Instead of just "learning" C++, I wanted to learn by building, so here it is. Its not the greatest Task Scheduler out there, but it taught me the core language features and class designs.
